# TalChess backend repo

## Setup
To run the server run `node index --server`

## Plan
### Priority task
0) API test
1) API - Login / create account (+social)

### Later
2) API - Get lines (return all available lines)
3) API - Create line (create a new custom line)
4) API - Edit line (edit existing line created by the user)
5) API - Delete line (delete a line created by the user)
6) API - Add line to study queue (add a line to the users queue) 
7) API - Remove line from study queue (remove from users queue)
8) API - Create learning session (create a session based on the users study queue)

### Bigger task
1) put lines to db and create a API which returns all of them in an array
2) Paginate afterwards
