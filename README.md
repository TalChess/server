# TalChess backend repo

## Setup
To run the server run `node index --server`

## Plan
### Priority tasks
- API test
- API - Login / create account (+social)
- Add prettier package (and probably husky also necessary)

### Later
- API - Get lines (return all available lines)
- API - Create line (create a new custom line)
- API - Edit line (edit existing line created by the user)
- API - Delete line (delete a line created by the user)
- API - Add line to study queue (add a line to the users queue) 
- API - Remove line from study queue (remove from users queue)
- API - Create learning session (create a session based on the users study queue)

### Bigger tasks
- Put lines to db and create a API which returns all of them in an array
- Paginate afterwards
